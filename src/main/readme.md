wliu67 lab 4 readme

1.Your understanding of the difference between the forward and redirect operations.
①Forwarding is done on the server side, and redirection is done on the client side. 
②The forwarding speed is fast and the redirection speed is slow. 
③Forwarding is the same request, and redirection is two different requests. 
④Forwarding will not execute the code after forwarding, and redirection will execute the code after redirection. 
⑤The forwarding address bar has not changed, and the redirection address bar has changed. 
⑥Forwarding must be completed under the same server, and redirection can be completed under different servers.
2.How would you be validating user submissions without the Bean Validation API standard?
There are many relatively complex ways, such as verifying user submissions on the server side.
3.How do you think this approach would scale to a real application with 100's of entities?
I think we should do an interaction with the database to make it obtain powerful functions to deal with more than 100 actual individuals.
4.Why didn't we need to include any additional dependencies (i.e. Bean Validation, JDBC) in Lab 4, like we did in Lab 3?
We have included the Jakarta enterprise network, all of which are already included.
